		        [Abstract 2021] Study of the lander and rover histories of dust accumulation on and removal from solar arrays on Mars</br></br>	
			Introduction: The decline in energy output of solar arrays due to dust on Mars landers and rovers is very problematic for long time surface operations. A typical loss of 0.2% per Sol seems to give a good projection of the degradation in electrical output. Throughout the first 800 Sols of the ongoing InSight mission, as well as the shorter Mars Pathfinder and Phoenix missions, this near-universal empirical scheme of dust attenuation has been observed. This rate was also experienced by the Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, but accumulation periods were episodically altered by unexpected dust cleaning events.
			</br></br>Method: Seeking how the dust is removed from solar arrays has led to a thorough study of the literature and the observations are compared with two large-scale database for computing the convective vortices activity and the surface wind stress combined with others engineering and atmospheric parameters.
			</br></br>Results: Dust deposition and removal from the solar array surfaces has been tracked and seasonal and annual trends have been identified. Surface wind stress and convective vortices seem to be important for dusting off the solar arrays of rover and lander. Dust cleaning event are mainly due to whirlwinds and wind gusts, especially during dust storms, that happen in particular conditions contingent upon local meteorological and surrounding surface properties.
			</br></br>Conclusions: These large increase of lifespan of solar-powered rovers may have given an idea of the long-term viability of solar array on the Martian surface that is not generally valid. Although, this study add a growing body of evidence that wind gusts and dust devils cause dust removal; motion-induced inclination and vibration or solar cells properties probably also act, but no direct correlation have been studied, warranting further researches.

			[Abstract 2022] Building a multi-annual database of regional large-scale dust events on Mars from Column Dust Optical Depth dataset</br></br>
			Introduction: Large-scale regional dust storms clearly affect the climatology and meteorology of Mars that is why knowing and understanding such phenomena is really important for robotic and human exploration of the “Red planet”. These events are known to originate and travel in specific regions but how, when and at which intensity they occur, in addition to the link they have with global dust storms, have still to be clarified.
			</br></br>Method: Large-scale regional dust storms were manually outlined using the Climatologies of the Martian Atmospheric Dust Optical Depth2 dataset from orbiters observations between Martian Year (MY) 24 to 36 (excluding MY25-28 and 34 which are global dust storm Martian years and MY27 due to lack of data). A threshold constrained the dust opacities values to highlight dust events. A user-friendly code allows to user to simply select what he guesses to be a dust event and several computations leading to desired outputs are done.
			</br></br>Results: A multi-annual database of large-scale regional dust events has been constructed with more than 50 dust events over 9 MYs. The spatial distribution confirms the results from the literature so that large-scale regional dust storms mainly originate in three channel: Arcadia, Acidalia and Utopia driven by baroclinic waves. The temporal distribution suggests inter-annual and seasonal pattern with five seasons: a very early one (𝐿𝑆 ~ 30°−60°), an early one (𝐿𝑆 ~ 140°−200°), a main and first major one (𝐿𝑆 ~ 200°−260°), a solstitial pause (𝐿𝑆 ~ 260°−300°) and a late and second major one (𝐿𝑆 ~ 300°−360°). Area against mean of normalized Column Dust Optical Depth (CDOD) plotted in function the season and the region reveals linearly-extended clusters suggesting linear relationship between area and dust opacity and opening new researches prospects.
			</br></br>Conclusions: This infrared maps-based dataset has been built up manually and therefore, it is strongly affected by subjective interpretation and potential human errors. Further researchers are warranting by the intrinsic aspect of this work. Indeed, the next step of this work should be hinged on an automatic detection of dust storms from CDOD maps with probably machine learning and/or deep learning techniques.

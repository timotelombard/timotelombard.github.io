			Building a multi-annual database of large-scale regional Martian dust storms from Column Dust Optical Depth dataset.
			Introduction: Large-scale regional dust storms clearly affect the climatology and meteorology of Mars that is why knowing and understanding such phenomena is really important for robotic and human exploration of the “Red planet”. These events are known to originate and travel in specific regions but how, when and at which intensity they occur, in addition to the link they have with global dust storms, have still to be clarified.
			Method: Large-scale regional dust storms were manually outlined using the Climatologies of the Martian Atmospheric Dust Optical Depth2 dataset from orbiters observations between Martian Year (MY) 24 to 36 (excluding MY25-28 and 34 which are global dust storm Martian years and MY27 due to lack of data). A threshold constrained the dust opacities values to highlight dust events. A user-friendly code allows to user to simply select what he guesses to be a dust event and several computations leading to desired outputs are done.
			Results: A multi-annual database of large-scale regional dust events has been constructed with more than 50 dust events over 9 MYs. The spatial distribution confirms the results from the literature so that large-scale regional dust storms mainly originate in three channel: Arcadia, Acidalia and Utopia driven by baroclinic waves. The temporal distribution suggests inter-annual and seasonal pattern with five seasons: a very early one (𝐿𝑆 ~ 30°−60°), an early one (𝐿𝑆 ~ 140°−200°), a main and first major one (𝐿𝑆 ~ 200°−260°), a solstitial pause (𝐿𝑆 ~ 260°−300°) and a late and second major one (𝐿𝑆 ~ 300°−360°). Area against mean of normalized Column Dust Optical Depth (CDOD) plotted in function the season and the region reveals linearly-extended clusters suggesting linear relationship between area and dust opacity and opening new researches prospects.
			Conclusions: This infrared maps-based dataset has been built up manually and therefore, it is strongly affected by subjective interpretation and potential human errors. Further researchers are warranting by the intrinsic aspect of this work. Indeed, the next step of this work should be hinged on an automatic detection of dust storms from CDOD maps with probably machine learning and/or deep learning techniques.

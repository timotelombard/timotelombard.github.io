      oward the development of an innovative solution for removing the dust accumulated on photovoltaic arrays at the surface of the Moon for future robotic and human lunar exploration missions
      </br></br>Dust generation, suspension and deposition is ubiquitous on the Moon. Although lunar dust properties may be well known, lunar dust dynamics is more uncertain. Short-term missions to return to the Moon as a springboard for long-term occupation of the lunar surface are focusing the attention of scientists and engineers on the development of a lunar base. It is expected that such facilities will use photovoltaic arrays for power generation. Applying solar-powered systems in harsh environments like the Moon goes along with numerous and various challenges. In addition to radiations, dust affects the efficiency of the solar cells by substantially decreasing the Sun irradiance. Natural causes of dust, including radiation and micrometeorites, can generate cloud at large scales, while anthropogenic activities, although more localized, can be more significant. In this paper, some lunar dust properties are thoroughly analyzed and the effects of a lunar soil simulant on the performances of a photovoltaic module are investigated experimentally, within laboratory conditions. The Current-Voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured while increasing the lunar dust layer on the solar panel. A first regime named “coating” associated with a linear decline and a second regime named “overlapping” associated with an exponential decline were identified in accordance with what suggested in literature. According to the model established from experiments, if a semi-annual or an annual cleaning would be planned, the associated power loss would be between ~0.5% - 2.5% or between ~1% - 5.5%, respectively.

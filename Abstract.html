			 Introduction: The decline in energy output of solar arrays due to dust on Mars landers and rovers is very problematic for long time surface operations. A typical loss of 0.2% per Sol seems to give a good projection of the degradation in electrical output. Throughout the first 800 Sols of the ongoing InSight mission, as well as the shorter Mars Pathfinder and Phoenix missions, this near-universal empirical scheme of dust attenuation has been observed. This rate was also experienced by the Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, but accumulation periods were episodically altered by unexpected dust cleaning events.
			</br></br>Method: Seeking how the dust is removed from solar arrays has led to a thorough study of the literature and the observations are compared with two large-scale database for computing the convective vortices activity and the surface wind stress combined with others engineering and atmospheric parameters.
			</br></br>Results: Dust deposition and removal from the solar array surfaces has been tracked and seasonal and annual trends have been identified. Surface wind stress and convective vortices seem to be important for dusting off the solar arrays of rover and lander. Dust cleaning event are mainly due to whirlwinds and wind gusts, especially during dust storms, that happen in particular conditions contingent upon local meteorological and surrounding surface properties.
			</br></br>Conclusions: These large increase of lifespan of solar-powered rovers may have given an idea of the long-term viability of solar array on the Martian surface that is not generally valid. Although, this study add a growing body of evidence that wind gusts and dust devils cause dust removal; motion-induced inclination and vibration or solar cells properties probably also act, but no direct correlation have been studied, warranting further researches.
